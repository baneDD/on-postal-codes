# Ontario Postal Codes

A small node script to parse and modify the listing of all Ontario postal codes along with their coordinates. It creates an output folder that has each FSA (Forward Sortation Area) as a separate JSON file. Those files in turn have a list of postal codes (last three digits) along with their geocoordinates.
